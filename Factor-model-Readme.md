## Factor Model: Visualize Yourself Project
### Title:  Relationship of Sleep Patterns and Weekly Habits 

I am to see how my work, screen time, exercise habits and bedtimes all affect my overall sleep quality

##### I will actively log these variables which are originally measured from my devices:
 - Wake up time
 - Meditative practice before bedtime
 - Previous night’s hours slept
 - Alcohol consumed (# drinks)


##### I will passively collect these variables daily:
 - Wake up time (via Fitbit)
 - Total daily steps (via Fitbit)
 - Total calories burned (via Fitbit)
 - Time in sleep cycles (via Fitbit)
 - Screen time on phone (via iPhone)
 - Resting heart rate (via Fitbit)
